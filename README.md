## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Demonstrates the application of CNNs, specialized deep learning models for processing data with a grid-like topology, like image data.

## McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Model

Explores the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, one of the earliest and simplest artificial neuron models.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Various notebooks explore the implementation and application of ANNs, including sentiment analysis and explainable AI techniques.

## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

Introduces the DCGAN, a type of GAN where the generator and discriminator are deep CNNs.

## Image Captioning with CNN

Showcases how CNNs can be used for the task of image captioning, generating descriptive text for images.

## Perceptron Model

Delves into the perceptron model, a single-layer binary linear classifier.

## Setup and Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks:

1. Ensure Jupyter is installed.
2. Navigate to the desired directory.
3. Launch Jupyter and open the desired notebook.
